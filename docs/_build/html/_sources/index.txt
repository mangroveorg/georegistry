   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Georegistry's documentation!
=======================================

Georegistry is a Geospatial Health RESTful Webservice.  You can think of it
like a back-end database for displaying information in GoogleMaps
and other mapping software. You can say things like, “Show me all the elementary
schools in Nigeria” or “Show me all the water points in Ghana”. It returns data
in GeoJSON format which is easy for many different Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) to use as input.
